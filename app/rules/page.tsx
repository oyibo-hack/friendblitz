              <h3>1. Welcome to FriendsBlitz!</h3>
              <p>
                By using FriendsBlitz, you&apos;re agreeing to follow these
                rules. If you donâ€™t agree, you wonâ€™t be able to use our
                platform.
              </p>

              <h3>2. Who Can Join?</h3>
              <p>
                You need to be at least 16 years old to sign up and start
                earning rewards.
              </p>

              <h3>3. Your Account</h3>
              <p>
                To get rewards, youâ€™ll need an account. Keep your login details
                safeâ€”youâ€™re responsible for everything that happens under your
                account.
              </p>

              <h3>4. Registration Fees</h3>
              <p>
                FriendsBlitz may charge a fee for registration. If a fee
                applies, it will be clearly stated before you sign up.
              </p>

              <h3>5. How the Referral Program Works</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Invite your friends to sign up, and youâ€™ll earn rewards like
                  airtime, SMS, and data.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your friends must complete the signup and activation steps for
                  you to earn rewards.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Rewards canâ€™t be exchanged for cash or transferred to someone
                  else.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>6. No Cheating ðŸš«</h3>
              <p>To keep things fair, you CANâ€™T:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Use fake accounts or misleading tricks to get referrals.
                </li>
                <li>Sign up multiple times using different emails or names.</li>
                <li>
                  Break any rules set by mobile carriers or other services
                  involved in the rewards.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>7. Privacy Matters</h3>
              <p>
                We respect your privacy. Your data is safe with us and used only
                as explained in our <a href="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.
              </p>

              <h3>8. Claiming Your Rewards</h3>
              <p>
                You can redeem your rewards based on the rules listed on the
                site. FriendsBlitz might change the rewards or how they work at
                any time.
              </p>

              <h3>9. If You Break the Rules...</h3>
              <p>
                If we find out youâ€™re breaking these rules, we may suspend or
                even delete your account.
              </p>

              <h3>10. No Guarantees</h3>
              <p>
                We try our best to keep everything running smoothly, but we
                canâ€™t promise rewards will always be available.
              </p>

              <h3>11. Updates to These Rules</h3>
              <p>
                We may update these rules from time to time. If you keep using
                the site after changes, that means you accept them.
              </p>

              <h3>12. The Legal Stuff</h3>
              <p>
                These rules are based on the laws of [Your Country or Region].
